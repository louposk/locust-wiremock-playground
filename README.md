# Locust and Wiremock playground

# Locust
Locust is an easy to use, scriptable and scalable performance testing tool written in Python.

You define the behaviour of your users in regular Python code, instead of being stuck in a UI or restrictive domain specific language.

This makes Locust infinitely expandable and very developer friendly.

# Wiremock
WireMock is an HTTP mock server. At its core it is web server that can be primed to serve canned responses to particular requests (stubbing) and that captures incoming requests so that they can be checked later (verification).

It also has an assortment of other useful features including record/playback of interactions with other APIs, injection of faults and delays, simulation of stateful behaviour.

It can be used as a library by any JVM application, or run as a standalone process either on the same host as the system under test or a remote server.

All of WireMockâ€™s features are accessible via its REST (JSON) interface and its Java API. Additionally, stubs can be configured via JSON files.
